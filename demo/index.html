    <h1>js-curses</h1>
    
    <p>An interface for JavaScript that is pretty much copied from the
      <code>ncurses</code> library, and can be used to make "text-mode" interfaces
      inside a web browser. Click the console "window" to give it focus, and then
      you can start using it as you would for any console application that has
      a curses user interface. This library could be used to create many
      applications; for instance, a music player, a video game, or a text editor,
      inside the web browser.</p>

    <div class="panel panel-info">
      <div class="panel-heading">
	<h3 class="panel-title">
          <em>Nota bene</em>
	</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
	<p>If the console does not have focus (which it gains by being clicked
	  on), pressing keys has no effect.</p>

	<p>Additionally, this library has yet to be tested on browsers other than
	  Firefox and Chrome. Chances are it won't work in most other web browsers.

    <h2>Demonstration</h2>

    <p>This small demonstration contains a few, very simple, examples of things
      that can be done using <code>js-curses</code>. Use the <kbd>arrow keys</kbd>
      to select an example, then press <kbd>enter</kbd> to start that example. There
      is also a simple benchmarker, which redraws the whole screen as often as
      possible, and displays how many frames per second it has.</p>
